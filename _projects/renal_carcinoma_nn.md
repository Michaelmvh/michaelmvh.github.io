I joined this Informatics Skunkworks project during my last semester at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I created a pipeline to convert the segmented mat files into images that contained only the relevant area. I then used transfer learning to train a model that would classify a carcinoma as low grade or high grade.

The actual data used has been excluded due to data handling guidelines
