I joined this Informatics Skunkworks project during my last semester at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. For this project, we were given three dimensional CT images and a script to segment these images into only the relevant area, specifically the kidney. I made some tweaks to the segmenting script and created a pipeline to convert the segmented three dimensional mat files into two dimensional images. The pipeline allowed for converting the three dimensional scan into a series of two dimensional images or an individual image based on chosen criteria (largest slice, middle slice, etc.). I then used transfer learning to train a model that would classify a carcinoma as low grade or high grade. Though I was able to see some initial results, I graduated before being able to see this project to completion.
