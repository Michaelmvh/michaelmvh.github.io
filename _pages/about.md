Hello, my name is Michael Vanden Heuvel. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft working on Microsoft Sentinel.

<!-- Talk about work at Microsoft -->

During my undergrad, I was a member of the [Informatics Skunkworks](https://skunkworks.engr.wisc.edu/) research group led by Dr. Dane Morgan. I worked on several projects in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine Department of Radiology. I worked on projects including pacreatic cyst classification and renal AML classification and regression. For more information, visit my [projects](/projects/) and [publication](/publications/) pages.

In addition to my research, I served as the event management lead for the Google Developer Students Club at UW-Madison, where I led the creation of the CheeseHacks hackathon. During my time with the club, we tripled chapter membership!

Outside of my technical work, I have been passionate about computer science outreach. I have taught computer science to college, high school, and elementary school students. As a peer mentor at the college level, I held office hours, designed and proctored exams, hosted mock exams, and led a lab section. Through Microsoft TEALS, I volunteered as a teaching assistant for Shiocton High School. During fall of 2022, I was a volunteer for a local elementary school's Scratch programming club.

I currently live in Seattle where I enjoy running, hiking, [baking](/baking/), and visiting local coffee shops and bookstores.
