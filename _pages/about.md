### About Me

I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft and a recipient of the [National Science Foundation CSGrad4US Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships). I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine Learning and molecular biology. I am particularly interested in leveraging generative modeling (diffusion, flow matching) to accelerate therapeutic design and protein engineering. I am currently applying to CS PhD programs for Fall 2026.

### Research Experience

During my undergrad, I was a member of the [Informatics Skunkworks](https://skunkworks.engr.wisc.edu/) research group led by Dr. Dane Morgan. I worked on several projects in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine Department of Radiology. I worked on projects including pancreatic cyst classification and renal AML classification and regression. For more information, visit my [projects](/projects/) and [publication](/publications/) pages.

### Professional Experience

Since 2023, I have worked as a software engineer in Microsoft Security on the Microsoft Sentinel platform. I have led the end-to-end delivery of high-visibility features, including the Product-Led Growth (SIEM Upsell) initiative, streamlining the Sentinel onboarding experience from a complicated multi-step process into a two-click operation. My work spans the full stack: from [developing Bicep template support for CI/CD scenarios](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftsentinelblog/whats-new-bicep-support-in-microsoft-sentinel-repositories/4358490) to implementing core backend services using .NET, Azure Functions, and CosmosDB. Most recently, I drove the UX efforts for the General Availability of Sentinel Repositories and Table Management, while contributing to the design of the transformation services. I am also deeply involved in service reliability, leading livesite investigations and mentoring new hires to ensure engineering excellence across the team.

### Service & Outreach

**Wet-Lab Instruction**: Most recently, I served as an Assistant Course Instructor at SoundBio Lab, where I guided students through "Microbiology Essentials," including sterile techniques, bacterial isolation, and antibiotic susceptibility assays. This Spring I will be helping with a Synthetic Biology course.

**Computer Science Education**: I have a long history of teaching, from volunteering with Microsoft TEALS instructing a high school Python course to serving as a Peer Mentor for Data Science Programming at UW-Madison.

**Advocacy**: I am an executive member of the Microsoft Security Disability ERG, where I host townhalls to raise awareness and foster an inclusive environment for employees with disabilities.

When I’m not at my computer, you can find me running, hiking, [baking](/baking/), or visiting local coffee shops and bookstores.
