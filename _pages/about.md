Hello, my name is Michael Vanden Heuvel. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft working on Microsoft Sentinel.

During my undergrad, I was a member of the [Informatics Skunkworks](https://skunkworks.engr.wisc.edu/) research group led by Dr. Dane Morgan. I worked on several projects in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine Department of Radiology. I worked on projects including pacreatic cyst classification and renal AML classification and regression. For more information, visit my [projects](/projects/) and [publication](/publications/) pages.

<!-- add note about Mingren, Dr. Lubner -->
<!-- Add note about Internship and what I do at Microsoft -->
<!-- Add more about CheeseHacks and include link and sponsor discussion -->
<!-- Include note about TEALS? -->

Additionally, I was a peer mentor for CS 220: Intro to Data Science Programming I. I held office hours, designed and proctored exams, held mock exams, and hosted a lab section.

While at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I was also the event management lead of the Google Developer Students Club. I helped organize events, including the CheeseHacks hackathon. During my time with the club, we tripled chapter membership!

I currently live in Seattle where I enjoy running, hiking, [baking](/baking/), and visiting local coffee shops and bookstores.
